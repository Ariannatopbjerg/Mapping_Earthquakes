# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose of Map
The map is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days (start date: 4/27/2021) in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. The map will also show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
